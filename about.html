    <h2 class="Introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <div class="inTro"><p class="p1">I am a passionate and dedicated 3rd year undergraduate student pursuing Metallurgical and Materials Engineering at IIT Patna. With a keen interest in the rapidly growing field of Data Science and Machine Learning, I am actively shaping my career in this domain.</p>

        <p class="p2">My exploration of Deep Learning has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of various concepts such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Data Science. I have gained proficiency in utilizing tools like TensorFlow, developing Neural Networks, implementing clustering algorithms, and creating accurate Machine Learning models.</p>
        
        <p class="p3">Furthermore, my programming skills include proficiency in C and C++, along with experience in web development encompassing both front-end and back-end technologies. This diverse skill set enables me to effectively contribute to projects and develop innovative solutions.</p>
        
        <p class="p4">Outside of academics, I actively engage in extracurricular activities.I am honored to serve as the Class Representative and a member of the Department Academic and Placement Committee (DAPC) for the Metallurgical and Materials Engineering branch.</p>
        
        <p class="p5">With a drive for continuous learning and exploration, I am seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge and skills in Data Science and Machine Learning to solve real-world problems. I am open to collaborations, internships, and projects that allow me to grow and make meaningful contributions to the field.</p>
